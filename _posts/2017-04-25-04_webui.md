title: ClojureScript React library (Rum)
---

[Source code of example usage is here](https://github.com/emnh/rts/blob/master/src.client/game/client/page_game_test.cljs). The settings on the right of the screenshots, like "Water Depth Effect", are all Rum.

I chose to use a ClojureScript React library called [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum). I don't remember why I chose this over [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om) or [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent). I think it might have been this point from the Rum readme: "No enforced state model: Unlike Om, Reagent or Quiescent, Rum does not dictate where to keep your state. Instead, it works well with any storage: persistent data structures, atoms, DataScript, JavaScript objects, localStorage or any custom solution you can think of." Anyway the point of using any such React library over plain HTML for me is that hot reloading comes for free. This does not apply to the three.js canvas though.
