title: Marquee selection

[The source code is here](https://github.com/emnh/rts/blob/master/src.client/game/client/selection.cljs).

I tried out 3 different approaches to get this working fast and accurate:
 - Subfrustum selection is fast, but inaccurate.
 - Projecting unit bounding boxes onto screen is slow.
 - Project unit bounding spheres onto screen is fast and accurate.
