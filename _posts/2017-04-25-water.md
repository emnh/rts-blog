title: Water

I adapted the [WebGL water code from Evan Wallace](http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/) to work with a terrain, although I was not successful in getting the caustics to render properly. Maybe I will try again later. The way to bounce off terrain was simply to return zero for the neighbouring cell which is terrain when averaging the 4 neighbours of a cell. Easy, right? :) I figured it out after studying the code of [this WebGL ripple tank](http://www.falstad.com/ripple/). I experimented with the shader first at [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsByzK) but ended up using a different simpler version for the game.
