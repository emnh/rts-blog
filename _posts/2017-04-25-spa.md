title: Single-page application

[The source code is here](https://github.com/emnh/rts/blob/master/src.client/game/client/routing.cljs) and 
[here](https://github.com/emnh/rts/blob/master/src.client/game/client/core.cljs).

I used the [goog.History library](https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.History.html) and wrote a custom solution for loading pages. Each page is a component, and also the game page component has a subsystem which contains the game components. I have a div for each page and mount Rum on it when the component starts. The single-page app code is a bit hairy, especially some hacks to differentiate switching a page and figwheel reloads and avoiding infinite reload loops, and since only one page should be loaded at a time starting the system is different from the standard Stuart Sierra component library call to start the system. It seems to work fine now however, so I am leaving a potential cleanup for later.
